# Hexo S3 Deployer

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@string-bean/hexo-deployer-aws-s3)
![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@string-bean/hexo-deployer-aws-s3)

Plugin for deploying [Hexo](https://hexo.io) sites to Amazon S3.

This is an alternative to the existing [hexo-deployer-s3](https://github.com/nt3rp/hexo-deployer-s3) and
[hexo-deployer-s3-cloudfront](https://github.com/Wouter33/hexo-deployer-s3-cloudfront) plugins that has been written
from the ground up to use the new AWS SDK v3.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -S @string-bean/hexo-deployer-aws-s3
```

## Usage

Add the following section to your Hexo `_config.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
  type: aws-s3
  region: us-east-1
  bucket: example-bucket
```

And then deploy using `hexo deploy`.

### CloudFront Invalidation

After deploying to S3 the plugin can optionally invalidate a CloudFront distribution to force a cache refresh. To do
this, add the CloudFront distribution ID to your Hexo config:

```yaml
deploy:
  type: aws-s3
  region: us-east-1
  bucket: example-bucket
  cloudfront_distribution: EXAMPLE123
```

### Redirect Rules

Adding S3 [webpage redirects][s3-redirects] is supported via entries in the Hexo config and via page front-matter.

:warning: Any existing webpage redirects configured for the S3 bucket will get overwritten by the redirects generated
by this plugin.

#### Via Front-Matter

With a `permalink` setting of `:year/:month/:day/:title/` and the following front-matter:

```yaml
---
title: Exciting Post
date: 2022-01-01 12:00:00
redirect_from: old-path.html
---
```

A redirect from `old-path.html` to `2022/01/01/exciting-post` will be generated.

#### Via Config

Additionally, redirects can be specified directly in the Hexo config:

```yaml
deploy:
  type: aws-s3
  redirects:
    'old.html': 'new-post'
    'another.html': 'pages/something/new'
```

Will generate the following redirects:

- `old.html` to `new-post`.
- `another.html` to `pages/something/new`.

### Cache Policies

Cache expiry durations can be defined on a per MIME type basis and are defined in seconds. Any unmatched MIME types will
be served without a cache header.

For example:

```yaml
deploy:
  type: aws-s3
  cache_policies:
    text/css: 86400 # 24 hours
```

Will serve the following header for CSS files:

```text
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400;
```
